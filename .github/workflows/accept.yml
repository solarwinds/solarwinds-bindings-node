      # Why Change Owner of Container Working Directory?

      # the working directory is created by the runner and mounted to the container.
      # container user is root and the runner is not a user in the container.
      # this is a github actions design flaw.
      # when npm 7 is run as root, scripts are always run with the effective uid and gid of the working directory owner.
      # node 16 can't install under default setup.
      # specifying workdir for container and path for checkout does not work due to bug.
